            <h5>SCORM Corporate Training with Adapt</h5>
            <p>This corporate client needed SCORM online learning content that would be responsive, WCAG A compliant, and easily translated into several langauges. They selected a subway map theme for content organization, and the content pages reflect this theme by portraying color-coded subway "paths" and subway stop "nodes". I developed several custom Adapt plugins in order to give the client the highly customized format they preferred. These Adapt plugin customizations include:</p><ul><li>A custom question type</li><li>A custom plugin presenting a responsive dialogue between two characters</li><li>A custom "more info" text feature</li><li>Customizations to the hotspotMenu plugin to add graphical progress display overlays on the subway map</li><li>Custom SCORM reporting</li><li>Custom navigation locking</li><li>Schema updates for full translation of the certificate and several other components</li></ul>

            <p>This was my first project with the talented folks at <a href="https://www.hyperobjekt.com/" target="_blank">Hyperobjekt</a>. This site uses Bootstrap 4 for navigation and layout responsiveness. Content pages loop through custom data files stored outside of the HUGO content directory. Many content fields are editable using Netlify CMS.</p>

            <h5>Accessibility Remediation Documentation Site with HUGO</h5>
            <p>User1st wanted to use a static site generator to create a documentation reference for their automated remediation tool and developer training programs. This site uses a modified version of the DocDock theme. I created a custom template for the rule documentation pages, and wrote a PHP script to convert CSVs of rule documentation into individual markdown files.</p><p>In subsequent updates to this site, I have added a Netlify CMS schema so that a11y criteria are editable via Netlify CMS. I have also added JSON custom content types to output all a11y standards, standards sorted by WCAG guideline, and standards sorted by tag. I have also retooled the navigation menu to sort all items by WCAG Guideline.</p>

            <p>Laurel needed a robust online promotion, scheduling, and marketplace solution. The theme Laurel had selected required a custom child theme for additional styling and course enrollment functionality. We did development in stages, using separate production and test environments to handle code pulls and site upgrades. Laurel now earns a significant passive income selling  video courses with the WordPress CMS, combined with WooCommerce and LearnDash plugins.</p>

            <h5>Online Accessibility Training Marketplace with Moodle</h5>
            <p>User1st wanted an online learning environment for the delivery of accessible SCORM training modules. The content we produced needed to meet the exacting accessibility standards advised in the training they contained. We chose the Adapt framework, and when it came time to test the SCORM content for accessibility, I was able to use CSS and JavaScript to alter the Adapt theme and plugins in order to improve screen reader accessibility.</p>

            <h5>Online Moodle Course Marketplace with Edwiser</h5>
            <p>SumLogix came to me with a legacy Moodle site and several existing Moodle courses. Their existing WordPress/Moodle integration was no longer functioning, and their Moodle site was long outdated. I manually upgraded the Moodle database through several major versions, updated the WordPress plugins and theme, added a child theme for UX updates, and tested and configured PayPal and Stripe purchase workflows. This site accepts transactions in multiple currencies, using the WordPress Currency Switcher plugin and geolocation to provide the customer with the appropriate currency.</p>
