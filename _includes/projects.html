            <h5>Online Learning Marketplace with LearnDash</h5>
            <p>Laurel needed a robust online promotion, scheduling, and marketplace solution. The theme Laurel had selected required a custom child theme for additional styling and course enrollment functionality. We did development in stages, using separate production and test environments to handle code pulls and site upgrades. Laurel now earns a significant passive income selling  video courses with the WordPress CMS, combined with WooCommerce and LearnDash plugins.</p>

            <h5>Online Accessibility Training Marketplace with Moodle</h5>
            <p>User1st wanted an online learning environment for the delivery of accessible SCORM training modules. The content we produced needed to meet the exacting accessibility standards advised in the training they contained. We chose the Adapt framework, and when it came time to test the SCORM content for accessibility, I was able to use CSS and JavaScript to alter the Adapt theme and plugins in order to improve screen reader accessibility.</p>

            <p>Amy needed a simple web site to advertise her consulting and analytics offerings. Amy came to me with a very particular aesthetic and image set in mind, and this site required extensive image editing, as well as some font set embedding, to make the site look just right despite the constraints of the Squarespace platform.</p>

            <h5>Online Moodle Course Marketplace with Edwiser</h5>
            <p>SumLogix came to me with a legacy Moodle site and several existing Moodle courses. Their existing WordPress/Moodle integration was no longer functioning, and their Moodle site was long outdated. I manually upgraded the Moodle database through several major versions, updated the WordPress plugins and theme, added a child theme for UX updates, and tested and configured PayPal and Stripe purchase workflows. This site accepts transactions in multiple currencies, using the WordPress Currency Switcher plugin and geolocation to provide the customer with the appropriate currency.</p>
